# Cyber Security Internship – Task 2: Operating System Security Fundamentals (Linux & Windows)

## What I Did
I converted the mini-guide into a structured task repository focused on OS security basics across Linux and Windows. I captured the guide text, organized the steps, extracted referenced commands, and documented risk-oriented analysis.

## Steps
1. Install a Linux virtual machine using VirtualBox or use Windows security settings.
2. Explore user accounts, permissions, and access control mechanisms.
3. Learn file permissions using `chmod`, `chown`, and `ls -l`.
4. Understand administrator vs standard user privileges.
5. Enable firewall (UFW in Linux or Windows Firewall).
6. Identify running processes and services.
7. Disable unnecessary services to reduce attack surface.
8. Document best OS hardening practices.

## Key Findings / Output
- Task number detected: **2**.
- Task title detected: **Operating System Security Fundamentals (Linux & Windows)**.
- Required deliverable identified: **OS security checklist document**.
- Expected outcome identified: **Understanding OS-level security and hardening**.

## Files
- `README.md`: Human-readable task summary and execution structure.
- `commands.md`: Extracted commands and terminal-related snippets from the guide.
- `analysis.md`: OCR text capture + summary, observations, risks, and mitigations.
- `assets/images/`: Stores the original mini-guide image.
- `os_security_checklist_document.md`: Placeholder deliverable referenced by the task.

## Analysis & Learning
This task builds fundamentals of host hardening: permission control, least privilege, firewall baseline, process/service reduction, and checklist-driven security operations. These directly reduce attack surface and improve system resilience.
